I looked at Monsieur Fogg

1: ... and I could contain myself no longer.
2: ... but I said nothing
?> ... and I could contain myself no longer.
'What is the purpose of our journey, Monsieur?'
'A wager,' he replied.

1: 'A wager!'
2: 'Ah.'
?> 'A wager!' I returned.
He nodded.

1: 'But surely that is foolishness!'
2: 'A most serious matter then!'
?> 'A most serious matter then!'
He nodded again.

1: 'But can we win?'
2: 'A modest wager, I trust?'
3: I asked nothing further of him then.
?> 'A modest wager, I trust?'
'Twenty thousand pounds,' he replied, quite flatly.
After that, we passed the day in silence.
