The radio hissed into life. "Three!"
I bought a coffee with my five-pound note.
The radio hissed into life. "Two!"
I bought a second coffee for my friend.
The radio hissed into life. "One!"
I didn't have enough money to buy any more coffee.
The radio hissed into life. There was the white noise racket of an explosion.
I didn't have enough money to buy any more coffee.
The radio hissed into life. But it was just static.
I didn't have enough money to buy any more coffee.
