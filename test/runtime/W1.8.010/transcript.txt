I heft the hammer.
The mole is in here somewhere. I'll show him!

1: Hit top-left
2: Whallop top-right
3: Blast middle
4: Clobber bottom-left
5: Nail bottom-right
?> Missed!
The nasty creature is hiding somewhere. But this time he won't escape!

1: Splat top-right
2: Hammer middle
3: Bosh bottom-left
4: Thump bottom-right
?> Nothing!
The mole is still at large.
1: Whack top-right
2: Blast middle
3: Clobber bottom-left
?> Where is he?
The blasted rodent is laughing at me.
1: Whallop top-right
2: Bosh bottom-left
?> Ah-ha! Got him!
